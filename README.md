# Misk DSI 2020-01 Week 2

Welcome to the second week of the Misk DSI course. This week we'll wrap up on on exploration of R and you'll build the first piece of your profile. 

**Register accounts & access whiteboards**

This week you should have the following set up:

1. Set up an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). Share your username with your teaching assisstant on Slack. We'll use this to follow your progress throughout the rest of the course.
1. An introduction to the concept of version control will be on this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kj14svU=/).

**Software to install**

This week you should have the following set up:

1. GitHub is just an online interface for Git, which you should have installed locally. Visit [install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and follow the instructions for your system.

## Course material for Unit 3 (Version Control) and Unit 4 (Classical Statistics)

On Sunday, we'll wrap up our discussion of R but looking at reproduible research in the form of report making [here](http://scavetta.academy/misk/Misk_DSI_R/_book/RR.html).

For the rest of the week, we'll explore version control and command line tools and then more onto classical statistics.

You can find the introduction to version control on these [pages](http://scavetta.academy/misk/dev_tools). 

The first chapters for our Statistics module is available [here](http://scavetta.academy/misk/stats/_book/index.html). We'll use a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kjFmlrY=/) to discuss the material in our group sessions.

## Profile building exercises

By the end of the week you should be confortable with the basics of working with Git and GitHub. You should also have a public repository of which your trainer and teaching assisstant are collaborators, so that they can push changes there.

You are expected to upload some of the scripts that you have been working on, for example the diamonds, the irrigation and/or the chickwt data set case studies.

For further building your portfolio you can continue to build up Exploratory Data Analysis scripts using data sets obtained from, e.g. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (you'll need an accound to access data) or the publically available data sets from the [tidy tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project (This is a GitHub repo, sroll down the readme file to the datasets section.
